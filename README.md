# ðŸ˜Œ calm

This is an experimental implementation of language model inference, aiming to get maximum single-GPU single-batch hardware utilization for LLM architectures with a minimal implementation. It is heavily work in progress.

If you need support for a wide range of models, computing devices or quantization methods, you're probably looking for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) or [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

This code is partially based on Andrej Karpathy's [llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c).

## Model format

calm uses [Safetensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/index) to store model files. Note that the models require conversion (see below), because calm stores model parameters in .safetensors metadata and may expect a particular set of tensor names or weight order within tensors that is not always compatible with the source. Tokenizer data is stored as tensors inside the model file as well.
